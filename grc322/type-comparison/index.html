        <h1>Adobe Garamond vs. Minion</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			     <h3>Adobe Garamond</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
                    <p>This serif typeface was created by the American typographer Robert Slimbach and released by Adobe in 1989. This font family was based on the typeface creation from Claude Garamond, a French printer from the sixteenth century. The italics are based on the designs from Robert Granjon, who was Garamound’s assistant.</p>
            
                    <p> Adobe Garamond is based on a typeface designed by Claude Garamond in the 16th century. The typeface was originally meant for use in books and body text. After undergoing many revisions throughout the centuries, Adobe picked up the font in 1989 and began using it as its corporate font until 2001. Its versatility has also allowed it to be used for logos, most notably Google’s original logo.</p>
            
                    <p>When Robert Slimbach released Adobe Garamond in 1989, many in the design industry appreciated its graceful interpretation of Claude Garamond’s original typeface.  Garamond does have a confusing past though. Sixty years after Claude Garamond passed, French Printer, Jean Jannon created a typeface similar to Garamond. Jannon’s office was raided by the French government, thus making the font the official Royal Printing Office typeface. The French National Printing Office claimed the type production of Adobe Garamond so the earliest version of Garamond in the 20th century was actually based on the Jannon font and not the Garamond typeface.</p>
             
			     <h3>Minion</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

                    <p>To mimic the beauty of the fonts from the late Renaissance, American typographer Robert Slimbach created this serif typeface, and it was released by Adobe in 1990. Along with Adobe Garamond, this typeface is a part of the Adobe Originals program. This program started at Adobe in 1989, and was meant to create original typefaces that are aesthetic, and have great design quality.</p>
            
                    <p>Minion is often used in situations where the highest level of legibility is required because it was revised from its earlier versions to be a master typeface, meaning that it utilizes optical sizing. This means that the version of Minion used on a billboard is different than Minion used on a newspaper, as the smaller text sizes are rendered with thicker strokes and larger serifs while larger sizes have more contrast between thin and thick strokes. </p>
            
                    <p>Minion’s lowercase letters reflect its Baroque typeface use by using old-style glyphs. The name Minion is from the traditional classification and naming of typefaces—minion is the size between brevier and nonpareil translating to 7 point in modern lettering sizes. These glyphs were known to be elegant and attractive because of their high readability during the Renaissance period.  Minion’s appearance relates to the mass-produced publication of the late Renaissance, but its new take includes crisper outlines.</p>

                             alt="Similarities in x-height comparison.">
				        <figcaption>The x-height on both is quite similar, but Minion’s is slightly taller.</figcaption>

                             alt="Similarities in O.">
				        <figcaption>As you can see, the “o” is quite similar and it’s hard to distinguish them from one another. The counter on Minion is just slightly taller.</figcaption>

                             alt="Differences in Crossbar, Terminal, Serif, Ear, and Bowl Comparisons.">
				        <figcaption>At first glance, these fonts look super similar but we will show you differences that will help you distinguish them.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                             alt="Crossbar Difference of H.">
				        <figcaption>At the intersection of the stem and beginning of the crossbar on “H” on both typefaces, you can see differences. On Adobe Garamond, you can see how the beginning of the crossbar has dips while on Minion’s, you can see that the intersection forms a perpendicular angle.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                             alt="Terminal Difference of a.">
				        <figcaption> You can see obvious differences in the terminal of the “a” on both typefaces. The terminal on Adobe Garamond ends more with a slant while on Minion, it ends more with a round, circular shape.
                        </figcaption>

                             alt="Serif Difference.">
				        <figcaption> The serifs on Minion are more extended from the stem of the character, making them wider than Garamond’s serifs.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

				        <figcaption> The ear on the “g” on Adobe Garamond is straight and horizontal while on Minion it slants upwards at a slight angle.
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

				        <figcaption> The bowls of Minion are thick and bottom-heavy, while the bowls of Adobe Garamond are much thinner.
                        </figcaption>

                             alt="e and s comparison.">
				        <figcaption>In Minion, the eye of the lowercase “e” looks similar to a semicircle and is almost symmetrical. In Adobe Garamond, the eye is smaller and not symmetrical. The left corner of the eye is sharper than the right, which is much rounder. In Minion, the spine of the “s” is thicker.
                        </figcaption>

				        <figcaption>The "&#38;" of each font look fairly different from each other, but the telltale indicator of each typeface is the spur. In Adobe Garamond, the spur is long, thin, and turned upward, while the spur of Minion is thicker and downturned.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

				        <figcaption>The terminal of the “?” in Adobe Garamond faces straight outwards and ends short, while the terminal in Minion curves downwards and is thicker.
