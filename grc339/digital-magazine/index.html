               <h3>An Intro to Risograph Printing</h3>
               <p>
                  Risographs took hold of the international art and design community almost four decades ago. Due to its affordability and small footprint, Riso became an easy way for artists and designers to produce their own work and publish work for others. Our friends at Risolve—a family-operated printing studio—join us today to shed light on the art of Risograph printing. Learn where it came from, what makes it unique, and how to start your very first Riso project.
