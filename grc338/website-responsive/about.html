				<h2>About 1415 Fulton Coffee</h2>
				<p>1415 Fulton was founded in 2020 by Gabby Ceja and Von Balanon, two Cal Poly grads with deep roots in the Fresno Area with specialties in the coffee and hospitality industry.</p>
				<p>
                    1415 Fulton is at the forefront of what we believe is the fourth wave of coffee—a firm commitment to ensure coffee production is not only high quality and sustainable, but a vehicle for diversity, inclusion, social and
                    economic restoration, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability. We are foodies, artists, activists, community folk, and innovators who love, love, love what we do.
                </p>
				<p>
                    1415 Fulton seeks to create unity by hiring and serving people of all backgrounds, striving to be diverse and inclusive of those who have traditionally been left out of the specialty coffee industry, especially people of
                    color, the formerly incarcerated, women and people with disabilities.
